# Getting started
## modify `interface`
1. **Modify the Interface Definition**: 
    - define and/or update the method signature. 
    - This change will immediately break the build for all code that uses a type that implements this interface.
1. **Identify Implementing Types**: 
    - launch a `go vet` or `go build`
    - failures allows to identify code to update
1. **Update the Implementing Types**: 
    - For each of the types you identified
    - add/update the new method to match the updated interface signature
    - To get your code to compile quickly: providing a method stubs
        - that have the correct signature but contain minimal logic.
        - this allows you to restore a working build and then implement the full functionality later.
## Testing the code
As the Go community, we are using the **white-box testing** by **keeping** test files **alongside** the code. It promote a **strong unit testing culture** 

This approach allows to test all functions, including private ones, for complete code validation.

A test in `Go` is just a **function** that starts with the string `Test` and takes `*testing.T` as an argument. 

A `GO` test file 
  - is simply any file in a **package** that ends with `_test.go`
  - is played whenever this cli occur : `go test ./...`
